	* tools/authors.xml: initial version of authors.xml for svn2log	

2004-07-02  Jason L. Shiffer <jshiffer@zerotao.org>

	* libzt/t/cfg_test.c, libzt/zt_cfg/cfg_private.c:	
	I do not know how this lasted but the cfg_ini interface would
	export strings to C in quotes such that: cfg.ini foo = 'this is
	a test' was noly satisfied by !strcmp(s, "'this is a test'")
	fix, quotes and double quotes are now striped
    

	* libzt/zt_cfg/cfg_lisp.c, libzt/zt_cfg/cfg_lisp.h: 
	These are being moved into zlisp

	* libzt/Makefile.am: Increased the library version of libzt    

2004-06-21 Jason L. Shiffer <jshiffer@zerotao.org>

	* ., aux, doc, libzt, libzt/t, libzt/zt_adt, libzt/zt_cfg,
	libzt/zt_log, replace, tools: added svn:ignore properties

2004-06-20  Jason L. Shiffer <jshiffer@zerotao.org>

	* libzt/zt_mem.c: During reorg of the zt_list interface I missed one of the 
	argument changes.  Funny that it got checked in as it would not
	even build.
	
	* trunk/aux, trunk, trunk/libzt/zt_cfg, trunk/tools, 
	trunk/libzt/zt_log, trunk/libzt, trunk/doc, 
	trunk/libzt/t, trunk/libzt/zt_adt, trunk/replace: 
	Added svn:ignore properties to ignore:
	Makefile
	Makefile.in
	any generated files
    

	* trunk/libzt/zt_mem.c: During reorg of the zt_list interface I missed one of the 
	argument changes.  Funny that it got checked in as it would not
	even build.
    

	* trunk/libzt/Makefile.am, trunk/configure.ac: 
	Ticket #1
	In the import I seem included the interim changes for zt_event.
	These have been removed and the build should work again.

2004-06-19  Jason L. Shiffer <jshiffer@zerotao.org>

	* all: Importing in an attempt to clean up my tree
	
2003-06-10  Jason L. Shiffer  <jshiffer@zerotao.org>

	* log_test.c: using the new LOG_NDEBUG et el.

	* syslog.c, syslog.h: appears that I forgot to merge the syslog
	branch oops!!

2003-06-09  Jason L. Shiffer  <jshiffer@zerotao.org>

	* file.c, stderr.c: fixed a small memory leak that would only
	show up under multiple logging target changes.

	* libzt/log.h: LOG_DEBUG/LOG_DEBUG_INFO changed to LOG_NDEBUG...

	* bootstrap: removed -i flag from automake (don't know how that
	got left there.

	* Makefile.am: forgot to add dummy.c as a dependency for
	libreplace so it was not included in make dist.

	* libzt/t/log_test.c: silly me I moved a couple of lines
	during code cleanup that actually caused the log tests to fail.
	Fixed.

	* configure.in: updated patchlevel version to 2

	* Makefile.am: changed back to includeing libzt/t in
	default build as it brakes the build otherwise.
