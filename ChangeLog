	* libzt/zt_mem.c: During reorg of the zt_list interface I missed one of the 
	argument changes.  Funny that it got checked in as it would not
	even build.

	* log_test.c: using the new LOG_NDEBUG et el.

	* syslog.c, syslog.h: appears that I forgot to merge the syslog
	branch oops!!

2003-06-09  Jason L. Shiffer  <jshiffer@zerotao.org>

	* file.c, stderr.c: fixed a small memory leak that would only
	show up under multiple logging target changes.

	* libzt/log.h: LOG_DEBUG/LOG_DEBUG_INFO changed to LOG_NDEBUG...

	* bootstrap: removed -i flag from automake (don't know how that
	got left there.

	* Makefile.am: forgot to add dummy.c as a dependency for
	libreplace so it was not included in make dist.

	* libzt/t/log_test.c: silly me I moved a couple of lines
	during code cleanup that actually caused the log tests to fail.
	Fixed.

	* configure.in: updated patchlevel version to 2

	* Makefile.am: changed back to includeing libzt/t in
	default build as it brakes the build otherwise.
